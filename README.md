# CS351_Project_2
Dijkstra, Greedy Best First Search, A-Star

Language: Python 3.13.2

How to run:
Run the program in the "program.py" file, it should ask for inputs in the terminal to use the 
Oregon Pathfinder code!

Other: 
Any path and algorithm will tell you the final route, the number of edges visited, the number of vertices visited, and the time taken to get this info. It is important to note that the number of vertices and edges visited is not unique edges or vertices (so the numbers may be very high for some routes).

Test Cases: 
They're all in my report!
